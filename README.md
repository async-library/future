# Async Library - Asynchronous UI done right

This repo exists to discuss and build the future version of [React Async](https://github.com/ghengeveld/react-async) and [react-async-hook](https://github.com/slorber/react-async-hook). Async Library is the overarching project where these will come together.

**We are looking for collaborators.**

Project goals:
- Merge `react-async` and `react-async-hook` (and potentially others) to a unified package
- Implement this in such a way that it can be easily extended to cover additional use cases and libraries

See [issues](https://github.com/async-library/future/issues) for topics under discussion.
